"""Device authentication middleware for Nest protocol.

Three-tier auth model:
  1. PAIRED   - Device has ownership record → full access
  2. PENDING  - Device has active entry key but no owner → subscribe OK, PUT silently dropped
  3. UNKNOWN  - No entry key, no owner → only entry + passphrase allowed, transport gets 401

The entry key displayed on the thermostat screen is the opt-in mechanism.
A server admin must physically read the key and claim it before the device
gets any transport access.
